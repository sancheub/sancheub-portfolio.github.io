        <h1>About me:</h1>
        <br>
        <p id="description">I’m a person of broken habits. A curious one. Always looking for learning of something new. New experiences, knowledge, new friends. <br><br>Victim of my own habits one day I realized my actions had been the same across my life. But something like that is not easy for the self esteem and I had to made a choice: To change every day something, even if it was a small detail. Running by a different path, tasting a new food or watching an interesting documentary… by doing these different things day by day the habits and behaviors change preparing our person to future adventures.
                <br>Then, walking in this way I discovered beautiful panoramas hiking early in a still dark morning, amazing movies, unbelievable stories hidden in five thousand-pages books, traveling to places I never had thought to visit, living experiences and achieving tons of good friends I wouldn’t have had if I was hidden in the room of my old customs. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It’s a good habit building new habits. </p>
